<h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anti-Spam and
Privacy Statement 

  </font></h3>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, more
than 

  ever, privacy is a huge concern among people throughout the
world. Although 

  this system allows businesses to obtain and retain customers through
e-mail 

  marketing, we understand the importance of privacy and therefore respect
the 

  expectations of the public. This system does not distribute or sell
members 

  confidential information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This e-mail
system 

  is utilized for sending permission-based e-mail from companies to their
opt-in 

  customers and partners. <br>

  <br>

  We are strongly opposed to unsolicited e-mail. Under the terms of our
customer 

  contract, we will not knowingly allow a customer to use our product to
distribute 

  SPAM, nor allow unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE). In regards to our
enterprise 

  software solution, we will not knowingly sell to companies that send or
plan 

  to send UCE/SPAM.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not
retain 

  e-mail address information after our users delete from our servers. We
do not 

  monitor or limit our users from creating e-mail messages. We do,
however, quickly 

  and fervently respond to notification of violations or abuses of our
Terms of 

  Service, including failure to honor opt-outs.</font></p>
